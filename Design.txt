Each food item should have a role and use. To this end each category has a 1.5x bonus, rounded, added to their consume stats;
    Fruit : Health / Low max decay
    Meat : Stamina / Low max decay
    Grain : Hunger / High max decay
    Vegtables : Thirst / Mid max decay

Foods which features two or more of these groups prominently should inherit all bonuses from the respective ingredients, the best decay category, and should also be harder to craft.
These foods will be put in the ComboFoods category.

Base stats for a food item should be taken from the vanilla stats of the ingredients with value added based on the complexity of the recipe.
